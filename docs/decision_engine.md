## Decision Engine

The decision engine evaluates possible responses using utility scores.

Each candidate response has:
- Intent
- Conditions
- Mood constraints
- Context relevance

The highest-utility response is selected.
Is based on the "Jaccard Similarity" aplied on the "Utility AI" concept. 
Just like a videogame... Like F.E.A.R or an JRPG.
