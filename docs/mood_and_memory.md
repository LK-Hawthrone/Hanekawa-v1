## Mood and Memory

Mood is an integer from -100 to +100.

It changes slowly and avoids oscillation.

Memory is shallow by design:
- Last inputs
- Last intent
- Simple flags

This keeps behavior consistent and debuggable.
That's awesome because that have an incredible expanding capability 
You just need to add more functions and vocabulary to the bot, the rules is flexible and with just one rule, multiple scenarios is possible. 
This isn't a "Transformer-like" and not compete with them, but, thats better than ELIZA, PERRY or ALICE "Good Old Fashion AI" (GOFAI) based chatbots and runs on low-end hardware
