# Hanekawa v1

Hanekawa v1 is a **Stateful Rule-Based Conversational Agent**.

and utility-based decision making can go **without machine learning**.

It is intentionally simple, readable, and hackable.

- Control over opacity
- Explainability over magic
- Behavior over realism
- High flexibility with Low human efforts
